### Hello

I have been working full-stack in web development since 2018, mainly in the JS/TS world.
By full-stack, I mean (including but not limited to) data model design, system solution, backend logics, frontend interface, feature discussions, client demos and communications :) 

My go-to tech stacks are: Reactjs, Tanstack, Nextjs, Nodejs, Postgres. Recently trying to ditch React. 

New year resolution of 2026, spend more time on Github and doing some opensource! 

Currently looking for a new job.
