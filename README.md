### Hi I'm Haochen

I have been working full-stack in web development since 2018, mainly in the JS/TS world.
By full-stack, I mean (including but not limited to) data model design, system solution, backend logics, frontend interface, feature discussions, client demos and communications :) 

My go-to tech stacks are: Reactjs, Tanstack, Nextjs, Nodejs, Postgres.

I quited my full-time job end of 2025, now I am hanging by a part-time job. Now that I have more free time, I want to do something more related to open-source, and learn something new, recently digging the source code of Svelte, and exploring what can I do with Three.js
